- get rid of LocalCoordinatesCanvas, fix documentation
- change how text is draw, make text gradually fade out when the font becomes too big for the viewport or too small that is unreadable
- improve test drawing, draw text on a box and set font size automatically
- fix resolution problem when zooming 30x, 40x etc, viewport, fonts size
- smooth zoom
- fix and enable clipping (will improve performance), fix Morph#fullDraw, EyeMorph#drawWorld
- optimize Morph#fullDraw, Canvas#setClipping, Canvas#setTransformation
- WorldMorph: keep eyes topmost, then hands, then rest of submorphs
- WorldMorph: forbid setOwner
- more coordinate systems (geographical other than equirectangular)
- document and improve physics simulation code, add examples
- BalloonMorph for tooltips
- scripting (try groovy and javascript, maybe jython, jruby)
- add LICENSE file
- add Makefile, create a jar, generate javadoc
- write a simple tutorial (maybe world map)
- fix unnecessary rendering (we're using a square buffer image to keep aspect ratio, can be done more cleverly)

examples (separate from the morphic jar):
- graphs
- ipv4 treemap (semantic zooming)
- world map (geographical coordinates), download the texture in the Makefile
- fractal morphs
- n superimposed pictures at different scales
- galileo experiment (drop 2 morphs of different mass on a simulation with gravity)

maybe:
- two windows on one world with two eyes
- improve hand gestures, make them more pluggable, maybe add event handlers as pluggable objects
- halos
- typing on air + scripting
