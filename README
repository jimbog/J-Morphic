ORIGIN

Java Morphic is an interactive structured graphics system based on the Morphic system originally developed for the Self programming language and later implemented in Squeak Smalltalk.

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphic_%28software%29

Java Morphic is not a port of any other implementation, and it doesn't include any
of the UI components that people familiar with Squeak would expect. It is scale-independent,
making very easy the implementation of ZUIs (zoomable user interfaces).
It also incorporates other innovative ideas from Morphic 3 by Juan Manuel Vuletich, such as
local coordinate systems. Other sources of inspiration and ideas include Prefuse (and Flare),
Piccolo2D and JavaFX.


FEATURES

Some features of Java Morphic worth mentioning:
- scale independent and pixel-independent, very easy to build ZUIs;
- arbitrary user-defined coordinate systems (cartesian, geographical, polar, etc);
- subsystem for physical simulations (massive/charged particles, forces, springs);
- allows semantic zooming (drawing routines can be scale-aware if desired).
